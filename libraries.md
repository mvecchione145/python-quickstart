# Python Libraries

Libraries are portable code that can be [Built-In](https://docs.python.org/3/library/) or installed via [pip](https://github.com/mvecchione145/python-quickstart/blob/main/libraries.md##pip).


## pip

"pip" is a command line tool that comes with python that allows you to import 3rd party libraries into your virtual environment.
